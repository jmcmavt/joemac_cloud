joemac.cloud - world's greatest website built on someone else's computer

This is a repo containing infrastructue as code for a website I made to demonstrate the use of modern cloud technologies. The repo is intended to be a collection of artifacts referring to where various best practices and security pitfalls may lie, and how to avoid making security mistakes while working with modern cloud workflows.
